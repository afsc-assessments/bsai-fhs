# Executive Summary

"`r spp[1]`" as currently managed by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (NPFMC) in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) represents a two-species complex consisting of true `r spp[1]` (*`r spp[2]`*) and its morphologically-similar congener Bering flounder (*`r spp[3]`*). In 2012, the BSAI Groundfish Plan Team moved `r spp[1]` to a biennial stock assessment schedule because it has historically been lightly exploited. A full stock assessment report was most recently produced in 2019 (Monnahan and Haehn, 2019, available online [here](https://apps-afsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/refm/docs/2019/BSAIflathead.pdf)). This year, a partial assessment is presented. In partial assessment years, an executive summary is presented to recommend harvest levels for the next two years, along with trends in catch and biomass.

`r spp[1]` is assessed using an age-structured model and Tier 3 determination. The single species projection model is run using parameter values from the accepted 2019 assessment model, together with updated catch information for `r paste0(range(2019, lastyr),collapse ="-")` and estimated catches for `r thisyr` and `r proj_range`, to predict stock status for `r spp[1]` in 2022 and 2023 and make ABC recommendations for those years.

## Summary of Changes in Assessment Inputs

This assessment used a single survey index of "total" Hippoglossoides spp. biomass that included the EBS "standard" survey areas and AI survey areas for the years 1982-`r thisyr` (Table 2). As was done in the `r lastyr` assessment, a linear regression is used to estimate a relationship between EBS shelf `r spp[3]` survey biomass estimates and AI survey biomass estimates; this relationship is used to estimate AI survey biomass in years when no AI survey occurred (by using the linear equation to find an AI biomass estimate in a particular year based on the EBS biomass estimate for that year). There was no AI survey conducted in `r thisyr` and AI biomass was estimated with the linear equation. The `r thisyr` total BSAI estimate was `r format(surv$obs[surv$year == lastyr], big.mark = ",")` t, an increase over the 2019 estimate of `r format(surv$obs[surv$year == 2019], big.mark = ",")` t.

To run the projection model to predict ABCs for `r proj_years[1]` and `r proj_years[2]`, estimates are required for the total catches in `r thisyr`-`r proj_years[2]` The final catch for `r thisyr` (`r format(cproj$catch[cproj$year == thisyr], big.mark = ",")` t) was estimated by adding the average catch between `r paste0(month(date_pull, label = T), " ",day(date_pull))` and December 31 over the years `r thisyr-5`-`r lastyr` to the `r thisyr` catch as of `r date_pull_long`. The `r nextyr` and `r proj_years[2]` catches (`r format(cproj$catch[cproj$year == nextyr], big.mark = ",")` t) were estimated as the average catch over the previous 5 years (`r thisyr-5`-`r lastyr`).

## Summary of Results

Based on the updated projection model results, the recommended ABCs for `r nextyr` and `r proj_years[2]` are listed in the table below; the new ABC recommendation and OFL for both `r nextyr` and `r proj_years[2]` are both slightly higher than those projected during the last full assessment (`r lastyr`).
