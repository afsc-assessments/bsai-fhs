# Overview

This electronic document describes the analyses undertaken to bridge the last "full" assessment of BSAI Flathead Sole (Monnahan, 2020) into the latest Stock Synthesis (SS3) software version, as well as explorations of sequential inclusion of recent data.

The general workflow was as follows: 

1) The 2020 model, referred to as Model 18.2c (2020), was moved from SS3 version 3.30.16 to the the newest SS3 software version as of December 2023 (3.30.22) downloaded from the [NOAA Virtual Lab](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/ss3-source-code/releases). Comparisons between model derived quantities and likelihoods are provided in this document. The version with the updated software is labeled as 18.2c (2024).

2) Compare the historical and newly-pulled data, and compare data from 2020-2023 between the old data pull approach (using code from Dr. McGilliard in the `newsbss` package) and the `afscdata` package. The latter is the preferred method since it is actively maintained and provides a unified approach for many stocks.

3)  Bridge the data obtained via `afscdata` systematically. The previous model has catches and fishery length comps thru 2020, and everything else thru 2019. There is also mean size-at-age data thru 2016 in this model. We added catches through 2023, with an estimate of 2024 catches, then survey abundance indices, then survey CAALs (marginal survey lengths & ages are ghosted, but included as well), then fishery lengths, then fishery ages. The impact of each of these five steps is documented below.

# Stock Synthesis Software Update 3.30.22

```{r include = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
mod18.2c_2020_v33022 <- SS_output(here::here(year,'model_runs','18.2c_2020_ss3v33022'), verbose = FALSE)
ss_compare <- SSsummarize(list(mod18.2c_2020,mod18.2c_2020_v33022))
```

## Warnings

M18.2c (2020) had generic warnings about the recr_dist method; poor FMSY convergence, and an issue with the final gradient. Only the latter is of concern. M18.2c (2024) threw the same warnings as well as an indication that the initial value for parm 11 was greater than the max (999\>5); this is the end logit for the survey selex (forcing it to be asymptotic). I am comfortable with the consistency of these warnings; the gradient is identical between models (`r  mod18.2c_2020$maximum_gradient_component`).

## Likelihood Components

```{r include = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
names(ss_compare$likelihoods)[c(1,2)] <- c('Model 18.2c (2020)', 'M18.2c (2024)')
ss_compare$likelihoods[c(1:7,11),]
SSplotComparisons(ss_compare, print = T, plotdir = here(year,'figs'), legendlabels = names(ss_compare$likelihoods)[c(1,2)], col = colvec)
```

## SS3 Bridging Conclusion

Based on the above explorations, I am comfortable that moving to the latest SS3 version is not impacting model behavior. After completing this exercise, I addressed the `warnings` in the latest model via the following. The warning-free model is in `model_runs/18.2c_2020_ss3v33022w`.
  + Change `recr_dist_method` to 4 (line 17) and removing associated stuff lines 99-101
  + Change the `INIT` for Age_DblN_end_logit_Survey to 20 and the MAX to 25 to get rid of the bound error. The selectivity is the same.
```{r include = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
m18.2cv33022w <- SS_output(here::here(year,'model_runs','18.2c_2020_ss3v33022w'), verbose = FALSE)
SSplotSelex(m18.2cv33022w, fleets = 2, sexes = 1)
```

# Data Exploration/Comparison
This section of the script assumes that one has already downloaded the data; to avoid separate scripts doing the same thing, I'm completing that step in `R/2024_analysis.R`. I wrote some functions for `afscdata` that reshape those data frames into the SS3 format, which is also accomplished in that script. 

The original data pull method is in `R/old_datapull_script.R`. I used that code to download data in the manner consistent with the historical approach, and below reshape it into the SS3 format for comparison as a one-off. 

The figures at the bottom of this section compare the key data sources both historically and within the new period from both approaches. The text headers describe any discrepancies between approaches.

## Catch data

Both queries call from the `council.comprehensive_blend_ca` table. I ran the `afscassess::clean_catch()` function on the downloaded data, and the summary code for t

```{r load dfs include = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
oldc <- 

## Aggregate catch to just year
annual_catch <- read.csv(here(year,'data','raw','2023-12-19-catch.csv')) %>%
  group_by(YEAR) %>% 
  summarize(total=sum(TONS), .groups='drop') %>% 
  data.frame()

## Build SS structure
SS_catch <- data.frame(year=annual_catch$YEAR, seas=1, fleet=1,
                       catch=round(annual_catch$total), catch_se=round(0.01,2))
write.csv(x=SS_catch, file=here('data',paste0(Sys.Date(),'-SS_catch.csv') ), row.names=FALSE)

newc <- read.csv(here(year,'data','raw','fsh_catch_data.csv'))

dim(oldc)
dim(newc)
names(newc)
names(oldc)

# Data Bridging
 Importantly, the data updates conducted here are holistic, meaning that the entire time series of data for each component (where available) is replaced with what is currently available in the AKFIN database. A comparison of each data source is provided below. The model that includes each change is named in the relevant header; these are hosted under `model_runs/`.
