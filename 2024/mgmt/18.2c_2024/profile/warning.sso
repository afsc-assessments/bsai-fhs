Note 1 Information: Std_yrmax=-1 in starter, so no variance output for forecast quantities after endyr+1 
Warning 1 : poor convergence in Fmsy, final dy/dy2= -0.357151
Warning 2 : Fmsy.mey is close to max allowed; check for convergence 
Warning 3 : Final gradient: 0.00210059 is larger than final_conv: 0.0001
Note 2 Information: A revised protocol for the Fcast_yr specification is available and recommended.
Note 3 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 2; check results, variance may be suspect
