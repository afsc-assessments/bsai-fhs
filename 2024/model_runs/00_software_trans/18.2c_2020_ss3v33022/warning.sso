Note 1 Suggestion: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.
Warning 1 : parameter init value is greater than parameter max 999 > 5 for parm: 11; search for <now check> in echoinput.sso for parm_type
Warning 2 : poor convergence in Fmsy, final dy/dy2= -0.247921
Warning 3 : Fmsy.mey is close to max allowed; check for convergence 
Warning 4 : Final gradient: 0.00150215 is larger than final_conv: 0.0001
Note 2 Information: A revised protocol for the Fcast_yr specification is available and recommended.
