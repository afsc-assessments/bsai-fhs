# Analytical approach

> Operational Update: The data description for Flathead sole-Bering
> flounder has been truncated to highlight relevant details and changes
> made for this cycle. The reader is referred to the last full
> assessment [@Monnahan2020] for the entirety of this section.

## General Model Structure

The model structure used for this Operational Update is unchanged from
2020. The POP assessment is a two-sex, age-structured statistical
catch-at-age model in Stock Synthesis (SS3, @methot_stock_2013). The
assessment model was transitioned from version `3.30.16` to the latest
version of SS3 available as of January 2024 (`3.30.22`). No detectable
change in derived quantities nor likelihoods occured as a result of this
software change.

## Description of Base Model

Given staffing limitations, this model is an Operational Update. The
configuration matches the accepted model from 2020, with updated data. A
full revision to the modeling framework is anticipated in the next cycle
(2028). There are no alternative models presented here.

## Parameters Estimated Outside the Assessment Model {#parest}

The survey catchability, time- and age-invariant natural mortality for
females and males, variability of recruitment ($\sigma_r$), the
parameters of the maturity ogive, the ageing error matrix, and the
weight-length relationship were estimated outside the assessment model.
The survey catchability parameter was fixed at 1.0. The natural
mortality rates were set to 0.2 for both sexes, and $\sigma_r$ was equal
to 0.5, consistent with previous assessments. The maturity ogive for
flathead sole followed an age-based logistic curve where age at 50%
maturity was 9.7 and age at 95% maturity was 12.8. The ageing error
matrix was taken directly from the Stock Synthesis model used in
assessments prior to 2004 (Spencer et al., 2004). A lengthâ€“weight
relationship of the form $W = aL^b$ was fit to survey data from
1982-2016 for males and females combined, with parameter estimates a =
0.00298 and b = 3.327 (weight in g, length in cm).

A comparison of these values is as follows:

|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| $w_\infty$, asymptotic weight                                                                      | 901 g            | 899 g         |
| $k$, weight-at-age growth rate                                                                     | 0.2 $kg yr^{-1}$ | unchanged     |
| $t_0$, age at weight zero                                                                          | -0.37            | -0.38         |
| $a$, $b$, slope and intercept of linear relationship between sd(length at age) and age, post 1980s | -0.02, 2.18      | -0.02, 2.17   |

An exploratory model was run wherein the 2021 size-at-age probability
matrix for 1980-present was used instead of the updated matrix;
estimated female spawning biomass and total (2+ biomass) for `r year+1`
varied by less than
`r max(c(round(100*(227991-227630)/227991,2),round(100*(649941-649010)/649941,2)))`%.
Therefore, updating the length and age data from the 2023 trawl survey
had minimal impact on model estimates of biomass.

## Parameters Estimated Inside the Assessment Model

: Parameters estimated within the assessment model.

### Recruitment

The log of unfished recruitment (R0), log-scale recruitment deviations
for an early period (1963-1972) and a main period (1973-2016) were
estimated. A 1:1 sex ratio is assumed.

### Growth

Sex-specific growth parameters (Lamax=21+, Lamin=3, k, CV of
length-at-age at age 3, CV of length-at-age at age 21+) were estimated
inside the assessment model.

### Selectivity and fishing mortality

Survey selectivity parameters were estimated using age-based,
sex-specific, asymptotic curves that were time-invariant and are listed
in the table below. The double-normal curve was used to easily allow
previous and future explorations of alternative survey selectivity
forms. Here the double-normal curve is constrained to mimic a logistic
shape because there was no evidence for dome-shaped survey selectivity.

Fishery selectivity parameters for logistic, length-based, sex-specific
curves were estimated (the parameters for each curve were the length at
50% selectivity to the fishery and slope of the selectivity curve).
Separate fishery selectivity curves were estimated for 2 distinct time
periods (1964-1987 and 1988-present).

Finally, annual fishing mortality rates were estimated (1964-2020).

: Treatment of selectivity parameters


### Objective Function

Parameter estimates were obtained by minimizing the overall sum of a weighted set of negative log-likelihood components derived from fits to the model data described above and a set of penalty functions used to improve model convergence and impose various constraints @methot_stock_2013. Fits to observed annual fishery size and age compositions, as well as survey biomass estimates and size and age compositions were included among the set of likelihood components. A likelihood component based on recruitment deviations from the mean was also included. Penalties were imposed to achieve good fits to annual fishery catches (biomass) and the assumed historical fishery catch. The functions used are described in more detail in Methot and Wetzel (2013) and in Appendix B of McGilliard et al. (2018).

# Model Uncertainty {#modeluncertainty}

Evaluation of model uncertainty is obtained through a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) algorithm [@gelman_markov_1996]. The chain length of the
MCMC was 10,000,000 and was thinned to one iteration out of every 2,000.
We omit the first 2,000,000 iterations to allow for a burn-in period. We
use these MCMC methods to provide further evaluation of uncertainty in
the results below including 95% credible intervals for some parameters
(computed as the 5th and 95th percentiles of the MCMC samples).
