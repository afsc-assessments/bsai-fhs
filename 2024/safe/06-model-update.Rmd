## General Model Structure

The model structure used for this Operational Update is unchanged from
2020. The BSAI flathead sole assessment is a two-sex, age-structured statistical
catch-at-age model in Stock Synthesis (SS3, @methot_stock_2013). The
assessment model was transitioned from version `3.30.16` to the latest
version of SS3 available as of January 2024 (`3.30.22`). No detectable
changes in derived quantities nor likelihoods occurred as a result of this
software change (see externally-linked document [here](https://afsc-assessments.github.io/bsai-fhs/2024_bridging_analysis.html#stock-synthesis-software-update-3.30.22) for more details).

## Description of Base Model

This model is an Operational Update. The
configuration matches the accepted model from 2020, with updated data. A
full revision to the modeling framework is anticipated in the next cycle
(2028). There are no alternative models presented here.

A total of `r nrow(mod18.2c_2024$parameters)` parameters were estimated inside the assessment model, `r mod18.2c_2024$parameters %>% filter(grepl('Recr', mod18.2c_2024$parameters$Label)) %>% nrow()` of which were annual recruitment deviations. A description of the treatment of all model parameters (fixed and estimated), their maximum likelihood estimates, and uncertainty intervals are provided in Table \@ref(tab:parposteriorst).

## Parameters Estimated Outside the Assessment Model {#parest}

The survey catchability, time- and age-invariant natural mortality for
females and males, variability of recruitment ($\sigma_r$), the
parameters of the maturity ogive, the ageing error matrix, and the
weight-length relationship were estimated outside the assessment model.
The survey catchability parameter was set to 1.0. The natural
mortality rates were set to 0.2 for both sexes, and $\sigma_r$ was equal
to 0.5, consistent with previous assessments. The maturity ogive for
flathead sole followed an age-based logistic curve where age at 50%
maturity was 9.7 and age at 95% maturity was 12.8. The ageing error
matrix was taken directly from the Stock Synthesis model used in
assessments prior to 2004 (Spencer et al., 2004). A lengthâ€“weight
relationship of the form $W = aL^b$ was fit to survey data from
1982-2016 for males and females combined, with parameter estimates a =
0.00298 and b = 3.327 (weight in g, length in cm).

## Parameters Estimated Inside the Assessment Model

### Recruitment

The log of unfished recruitment ($R_0$), log-scale recruitment deviations
for an early period `r (with(subset(mod18.2c_2024$recruit,era=='Early'),paste0(range(Yr), collapse = '-')))` and a main period (`r with(subset(mod18.2c_2024$recruit,era=='Main'),paste0(range(Yr), collapse = '-'))`) were
estimated. A 1:1 sex ratio is assumed. The age-0 recruitment was fixed to equal mean recruitment for the most recent four years because too few flathead sole are observed at ages 0-3 to estimate recruitment reliably. 

### Growth

Sex-specific growth parameters ($L_{amax=21+}$, $L_{amin=3}$, $k$, CV of length-at-age 3, CV of length-at-age 21+) were estimated inside the assessment model.

### Selectivity and fishing mortality
Survey selectivity parameters were estimated using age-based, sex-specific, asymptotic curves that were time-invariant and are listed
in the table below. The double-normal curve was used to easily allow previous and future explorations of alternative survey selectivity
forms. Here the double-normal curve is constrained to mimic a logistic shape because there was no evidence for dome-shaped survey selectivity.

Fishery selectivity parameters for logistic, length-based, sex-specific curves were estimated (the parameters for each curve were the length at 50% selectivity to the fishery and slope of the selectivity curve).
Separate fishery selectivity curves were estimated for 2 distinct time
periods (1964-1987 and 1988-present).

Finally, annual fishing mortality rates were estimated (`r paste0(mod18.2c_2024$startyr,'-',mod18.2c_2024$endyr)`).
