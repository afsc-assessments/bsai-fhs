Reviewer,Recommendation,Response
Tingley,"Continue to exclude the 1984 and 1987 survey biomass estimates and survey composition data from all future assessments as these are clearly not part of the longer survey timeseries due to the use of differences in vessels, trawl gear, tow duration and survey timing.",We will no longer be including these surveys in the POP assessment.
"Tingley, Cadigan","Exclude the 1990 and 1993 Gulf of Alaska Bottom Trawl Survey biomass estimates and the survey composition data from all future Pacific ocean perch (and other species) assessments (or include them only in sensitivities, possibly including them as a separate timeseries). These two years do not appear to be part of the longer survey timeseries due to different timing, tow duration and survey structure. ",We will investigate the model sensitivity to these surveys in the summer of 2022.
Tingley,"It is recommended that the current approach of estimating the missing eastern data from the 2001 Gulf of Alaska Bottom Trawl Survey is discontinued for all future assessments of Pacific ocean perch and that one of the proposed approaches, or an alternative approach, is used so as to reduce uncertainty in the next assessment.",We will investigate one of the alternatives in the summer of 2022.
Tingley,"Continue to support the development and application of spatio-temporal models (such as VAST) for use in stock assessments. In order to make this effective, there need to be a rapid development of a suite of informative diagnostics for spatio-temporal models in a fisheries stock assessment context. Until such time as suitable diagnostics are available, it is recommended that these spatio-temporal models are only used in sensitivity model runs and not in the base case from which management advice is developed.",We will be working with GAP to evaluate the VAST model for POP in the spring of 2022.
Cadigan,It was premature to use VAST biomass indices in the POP stock assessment. There are several diagnostic analyses that need to be explored.,We will be working with GAP to evaluate the VAST model for POP in the spring of 2022.
Cadigan,Provide the stratum size-weighted averages of the VAST ordinary raw residuals.,We will be working with GAP to evaluate the VAST model for POP in the spring of 2022.
Cadigan,"Provide trawlable biomass values aggregated over survey strata. This should include time-series of maps indicating strata, where each stratum is colored to indicate the area-expanded VAST biomass. Also useful are time-series plots of VAST biomass aggregated over sets of strata for standard depth ranges shown in Table 2. It will also be informative if this could be further divided into trawlable and untrawlable grounds.",We will be working with GAP to evaluate the VAST model for POP in the spring of 2022.
Cadigan,Account for potential vessel and tow time effects in a VAST model. Examine the statistical significance of vessel and tow duration effects. Consider including vessel as a random effect.,We will be working with GAP to evaluate the VAST model for POP in the spring of 2022.
Cadigan,"Consider including the 1984 and 1987 survey catches in the VAST model, to extend the survey biomass indices back to those years. This VAST model should include those effects that were different or less standardized in the 1984 and 1987 surveys. Consider the potential confounding of year effects with other effects.",We will be working with GAP to evaluate the VAST model for POP in the spring of 2022.
Cadigan,Investigate methods to produce length and size compositions that are weighted by VAST spatial density estimates.,We will be working with GAP to evaluate the VAST model for POP in the spring of 2022.
