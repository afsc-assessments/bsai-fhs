Reviewer,Recommendation,Response
Tingley,Exploration of additional information to better define the realistic range of M for Pacific ocean perch is recommended. This should consider data available for Pacific ocean perch and for other long-lived rockfish species.,"In the 2020 assessment we used Hamel (2015) as the prior for M. We will be performing sensitivities to M in the summer of 2022, as per the SSC request."
,,This sensitivity was investigated for the present cycle (see below).
Cadigan,"Investigate a sensitivity model run with an initial age-structure derived using the assumed M and a few years of F like that estimated for 1961. For example, initial cumulative Z = a*M + min(a,3)*Finit will be appropriate if the stock experienced Finit fishing mortality for three years prior to the start of the assessment model.",Within the internal review team we investigated alternative methods to estimate initial age-structure. We will revisit this with this recommendation in the spring of 2023.
Cadigan,Consider including a stock-recruit model with autocorrelated errors to improve the fit of the POP assessment model. Investigate possible drivers of patterns in recruitment deviations.,"We have been investigating time-dependent mean recruitment, and will revisit this analysis with this suggestion in the summer of 2022."
Cadigan,Consider removing priors for F Regularity and sigma-R.,This sensitivity was investigated for the present cycle (see below).
"Cadigan, Hyun","A research (i.e., exploratory) state-space stock assessment model, run in tandem with the current stock assessment model, should be developed.",We will begin to develop a state-space model after some of the higher priority suggestions have been addressed.
Cadigan,"Consider including fishery length composition information in off-years when ages are not measured. However, this may not provide much additional information about recent recruitment trends because of the low selectivity of the fishery for ages less than seven.",We will perform this request as a sensitivity run in the summer of 2023.
Cadigan,Evaluate the quality of fishery and survey age compositions for tracking cohorts.,"This is a common evaluation in our standard assessments. We feel that given the amount of funding and realistic level of sampling, that our age composition data is adequate to track cohorts."
Cadigan,Provide a retrospective analysis of current status evaluations. This will provide additional information on the reliability of the status evaluations.,We will perform this sensitivity analysis in the summer of 2023.
Cadigan,"Provide convergence diagnostics, including the maximum absolute gradient and the results of a jitter test.","This is potentially a broader topic, but we can fairly easily provide these diagnostics in the 2023 SAFE document."
