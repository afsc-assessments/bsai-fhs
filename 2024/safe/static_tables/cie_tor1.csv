Tingley,"Sensitivities to plausible alternative catch histories, particularly for the early years of the fishery, should be run, but only when there are substantive changes to the assessment model structure or major assumptions.",This sensitivity was investigated for the present cycle (see below).
Tingley,"Continue to explore different approaches to the appropriate weighting of the composition data, by using different statistical approaches but possibly also by careful quality control of these data, excluding data of known poorer quality.","This has been continually evaluated since 2017, and the results are very sensitive to the biomass index used. We will present updated results in September 2022."
Tingley,"At a future assessment, it is recommended to try and incorporate all of the high-quality length composition data from both the survey and the commercial fishery, at least in a sensitivity.",We plan to investigate this sensitivity in the summer of 2023
Tingley,"Prior to or as part of the next assessment, explore whether the plus group should continue to start at age 25 or whether an older plus group starting age is more appropriate.","We have explored this in previous assessments, but will update this analysis in the summer of 2022. "
,,This sensitivity was investigated for the present cycle (see below).
Cadigan,"Investigate if stock weights-at-age from the survey are significantly (i.e., in the statistical sense) different than fishery weights-at-age. Also, investigate if there is significant temporal variation in both stock and fishery weights-at-age. Provide figures of how mean weight-at-age changes over time, with different panels for groups of ages (i.e., 1-5, 6-10, 10+). Consider using more efficient and less bias methods for analyzing size-at-age from length-stratified age samples (e.g., Perreault et al., 2019). Investigate spatiotemporal variation in weight as a function of length.","We have previously evaluated time-dependent and have compared between the survey and fishery. We will update this analysis in the spring of 2023, in particular with the different groups of ages, as well as new methods of length-stratified sampling."

Cadigan,Consider new sampling programs to collect information on POP maturity.,"TBD, dependent on funding"
Cadigan,"Investigate a bootstrap re-sampling procedure (e.g., Jourdain et al., 2020) to estimate uncertainty (i.e., covariance) in survey age compositions. This could also be considered for fishery compositions, although I recognize that it may be less straight-forward if there is data-borrowing for unsampled fishery ?strata? (i.e., gears, areas, seasons, etc.).",Currently being investigated by Siskey et al. results for POP will be presented in September 2022
Hyun,"If the survey for the POP stock assessment continues to rely on a bottom trawl survey, they should consider increasing the current trawlable area.",The current method for selecting trawl sites will continue to expand our understanding of trawlable and untrawlable grid cells
Hyun,They should revise the calculation of the CV of annual bottom trawl survey indices (annual relative population sizes) because they failed to consider the covariances of survey indices from neighboring strata when calculating the variance of the annual survey index.,We will discuss the potential for this calculation with GAP in the spring of 2022.
