Tingley,"In the absence of better information about the likely magnitude of M, sensitivities using values of fixed M that bracket the estimated value M should be run in future stock assessments to inform on the level of risk inherent in the current assumptions about M.",We will perform this sensitivity analysis in the summer of 2022 and present the results of this in September 2022 Plan Team meeting.
Hyun,They should incorporate the annual fishery cpue?s into the assessment model framework.  ,"Historically, the fishery CPUE data for POP has been highly variable and questionable, which has caused doubt as to its usefulness in the model."
Hyun,They should improve the model fit to the survey indices.   One of the efficient ways to improve the goodness-of-fit might be to consider process errors in state variables (random effects).,We intend to develop a state-spaced model once more higher priority model developments are completed.
Hyun,"The penalized likelihood form as the prior of M, q, and ",We will investigate this in the summer of 2023
," must be revised (beyond the typo).  The revised form, which I suggest above, might improve the model performance.",
Hyun,"They should do formal model validation, setting true values of free parameters, generating pseudo data, feeding those simulated data into the assessment model, estimating parameters, and comparing estimates of free parameters with the corresponding true values.  Such model validation would help us to judge the reliability of parameter estimates and the resultant derived quantities made by the model.","Similar to the model convergence and jitter test diagnostics recommended in the previous TOR, this may be a broader diagnostic to consider in AFSC assessments, however, this model validation will be investigated in the summer of 2023."
Hyun,"For the retrospective error analysis, they should also examine estimates of annual fishing mortality.",We will perform this sensitivity analysis in the summer of 2023.
