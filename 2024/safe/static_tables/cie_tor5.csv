Reviewer,Recommendation,response
Tingley,It is recommended that attempts to develop an acoustic abundance index for Pacific ocean perch from the MACE Acoustic Survey data for use in assessments should be discontinued until the evidence base supports a substantially increased likelihood that the processed acoustic backscatter represents a reliable abundance index for Pacific ocean perch.,We will be continuing to work with MACE in 2022 and 2023 to investigate the utility of this survey in the POP assessment.
Tingley,"It is, however, also recommended that the existing MACE acoustic and trawl data are further explored in detail to ascertain whether the backscatter data can be reliably and robustly be decomposed into Pacific ocean perch and other species or not.",We will be continuing to work with MACE in 2022 and 2023 to investigate the utility of this survey in the POP assessment.
Cadigan,"More years of acoustic survey data are needed before deciding how it could be included in the POP assessment. However, having an additional fishery-independent abundance index, and in particular an acoustic survey of the off-bottom (i.e., 0.5m) water column, can be quite valuable for detecting changes in availability of POP to the bottom-trawl survey.",We will be continuing to work with MACE in 2022 and 2023 to investigate the utility of this survey in the POP assessment.
Cadigan,Continue and improve research on the sources of uncertainty and possibly bias listed above. This should include quantification and incorporation of these sources of uncertainty into acoustic biomass and age/size compositions.,We will be continuing to work with MACE in 2022 and 2023 to investigate the utility of this survey in the POP assessment.
