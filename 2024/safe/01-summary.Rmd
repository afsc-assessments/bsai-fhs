# Executive Summary

## Summary of Changes in Assessment Inputs

*Changes in the input data*: This assessment includes updated catch for `r year-1`, assumed catches of `r prettyNum(c1, big.mark = ',')` t for `r year`, `r prettyNum(c2, big.mark = ',')` t for `r year+1` and `r prettyNum(c3, big.mark = ',')` t for `r year+2` (see [How Future Catch is Specified](#authorsF) for details). Additional changes to input data include `r year` bottom trawl survey biomass, `r year-1`, fishery age composition data, and `r year-2` survey age composition.  

*Changes in the assessment methodology*: The assessment methodology is the same as the most recent assessment [@Monnahan2020].

## Summary of Results

For the `r year+1` fishery, we recommend the maximum allowable ABC of `r prettyNum(abc_24,big.mark=',')` t. This ABC is a `r round(100*(abc_24-abc_22)/abc_22,1)`% increase from the ABC recommended by last year's model for 2024 of `r abc_22p` t. The increase is attributed to the fact that the model has observed six consecutive survey biomass estimates larger than 1 million tons as well as an increase in survey biomass in 2023 compared to 2021. (This same dynamic resulted in increases in ABC from 2019 to 2021). The corresponding reference values for Pacific ocean perch are summarized in the following table. The stock is not subject to overfishing, is not currently overfished, nor is it approaching a condition of being overfished.
