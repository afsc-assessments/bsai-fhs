# Executive Summary

## Summary of Changes in Assessment Inputs

*Changes in the input data*: This assessment includes updated catch for `r year-1`, assumed catches of `r prettyNum(c1, big.mark = ',')` t for `r year`, `r prettyNum(c2, big.mark = ',')` t for `r year+1` and `r prettyNum(c3, big.mark = ',')` t for `r year+2` (Figure \@ref(fig:data)) and see [How Future Catch is Specified](#authorsF) for details). New input data otherwise include:

-    bottom trawl survey biomass for years 2021-2024;

-   survey length composition data for years 2021-2024;

-   conditional age-at-length data from the bottom trawl survey for years 2021 through 2023;

-   marginal fishery length compositions from 2020-2023; and

-   marginal fishery age compositions from 2020 and 2021. The Age and Growth program was not able to provide marginal fishery age compositions for more recent years due to staffing shortages;

-   replacment of the input sample sizes for survey compositional data with values obtained from the `surveyISS` package (previously, the number of hauls or the nominal sample size [number of otoliths] were used for marginal lengths and coniditional age-at-length data, respectively).

*Changes in the assessment methodology*: The assessment methodology is the same as the most recent full assessment conducted in 2020 [@Monnahan2020].

## Summary of Results

For the `r year+1` fishery, we recommend the maximum allowable ABC of `r prettyNum(abc_25,big.mark=',')` t. This ABC is a `r round(100*(abc_25-abc_23)/abc_23,1)`% increase from the ABC recommended by last year's model for `r year+1` of `r abc_23p` t. The increase is attributed to several years of elevated survey biomass, and that the projection model routine has been updated to use recruitment values from 1977-present to be consistent with programmatic approaches; these recruitment estimates are on average about 14% higher than the full time series (1964-present), which was previously used.
