# Executive Summary

## Summary of Changes in Assessment Inputs

*Changes in the input data*: This assessment includes updated catch for `r year-1`, assumed catches of `r prettyNum(c1, big.mark = ',')` t for `r year`, `r prettyNum(c2, big.mark = ',')` t for `r year+1` and `r prettyNum(c3, big.mark = ',')` t for `r year+2` (Figure \@ref(fig:data)) and see [How Future Catch is Specified](#authorsF) for details). New input data otherwise include:

-    bottom trawl survey biomass for years 2021-2023;

-   conditional age-at-length data from the bottom trawl survey for years 2021 and 2023;

-   marginal fishery age compositions from 2020 and 2021;

-   and marginal fishery length compositions from 2020-2023.

The Age and Growth program was not able to provide marginal fishery age compositions for more recent years due to staffing shortages.

*Changes in the assessment methodology*: The assessment methodology is the same as the most recent full assessment conducted in 2020 [@Monnahan2020].

## Summary of Results

For the `r year+1` fishery, we recommend the maximum allowable ABC of `r prettyNum(abc_25,big.mark=',')` t. This ABC is a `r round(100*(abc_25-abc_23)/abc_23,1)`% increase from the ABC recommended by last year's model for `r year+1` of `r abc_23p` t. The increase is attributed to the fact that the model has observed two years of elevated survey biomass in 2021 and 2022, and that the projection model routine has been updated to use recruitment values from 1977-present to be consistent with programmatic approaches; these are on average higher than the full time series (1964-present), which was previously used for projection purposes.
