## Responses to SSC and Plan Team Comments on Assessments in General

> "The SSC requests that all authors fill out the risk table in 2019â€¦" (SSC December 2018)  

We provide a risk table in the Harvest Recommendations section. After completing this exercise, we do not recommend ABC be reduced below maximum permissible ABC. 

## Responses to SSC and Plan Team Comments Specific to this Assessment

>*1. Continue exploration of environmental drivers of FHS stock distribution and behavior, as average summer bottom temperature appears inadequate (SSC, December 2018)*

This is out of scope for the present assessment, and might be addressed for the next Full assessment (2028).

>*2. Investigate data from the NBS for Bering Flounder (SSC, December 2018)*

Lee to investigate.

>*3. Consider separately modeling the pelagic trawl fishery with its own selectivity curve (Plan Team, November 2020)*

This request does not seem sensible for this stock, as there is not a pelagic trawl fishery for BSAI Flathead sole. This comment will be removed from future SAFE reports.
