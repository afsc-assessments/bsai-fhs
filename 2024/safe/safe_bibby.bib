Such models are typically most easily fit using Bayesian methods, which can often be implemented using simulation techniques. Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) methods are an important set of tools for such simulations. We give an overview and references of this rapidly emerging technology along with a relatively simple example. {MCMC} techniques can be viewed as extensions of iterative maximization techniques, but with random jumps rather than maximizations at each step. Special care is needed when implementing iterative maximization procedures rather than closed-form methods, and even more care is needed with iterative simulation procedures: it is substantially more difficult to monitor convergence to a distribution than to a point. The most reliable implementations of {MCMC} build upon results from simpler models fit using combinations of maximization algorithms and noniterative simulations, so that the user has a rough idea of the location and scale of the posterior distribution of the quantities of interest under the more complicated model. These concerns with implementation, however, should not deter the biostatistician from using {MCMC} methods, but rather help to ensure wise use of these powerful techniques.},

Automatic Differentiation Model Builder ({ADMB}) is a programming framework based on automatic differentiation, aimed at highly nonlinear models with a large number of parameters. The benefits of using {AD} are computational efficiency and high numerical accuracy, both crucial in many practical problems. We describe the basic components and the underlying philosophy of {ADMB}, with an emphasis on functionality found in no other statistical software. One example of such a feature is the generic implementation of Laplace approximation of high-dimensional integrals for use in latent variable models. We also review the literature in which {ADMB} has been used, and discuss future development of {ADMB} as an open source project. Overall, the main advantages of {ADMB} are flexibility, speed, precision, stability and built-in methods to quantify uncertainty.},

The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. {SS} implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of {SS} to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. {SS} is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within {SS} are provided.},

	abstract = {Traits underlie organismal responses to their environment and are essential to predict community responses to environmental conditions under global change. Species differ in life-history traits, morphometrics, diet type, reproductive characteristics and habitat utilization. Trait associations are widely analysed using phylogenetic comparative methods ({PCM}) to account for correlations among related species. Similarly, traits are measured for some but not all species, and missing continuous traits (e.g. growth rate) can be imputed using â€˜phylogenetic trait imputationâ€™ ({PTI}), based on evolutionary relatedness and trait covariance. However, {PTI} has not been available for categorical traits, and estimating covariance among traits without ecological constraints risks inferring implausible evolutionary mechanisms. Here, we extend previous {PCM} and {PTI} methods by (1) specifying covariance among traits as a structural equation model ({SEM}), and (2) incorporating associations among both continuous and categorical traits. Fitting a {SEM} replaces the covariance among traits with a set of linear path coefficients specifying potential evolutionary mechanisms. Estimated parameters then represent regression slopes (i.e. the average change in trait Y given an exogenous change in trait X) that can be used to calculate both direct effects (X impacts Y) and indirect effects (X impacts Z and Z impacts Y). We demonstrate phylogenetic structural-equation mixed-trait imputation using 33 variables representing life history, reproductive, morphological, and behavioural traits for all {\textgreater}32,000 described fishes worldwide. {SEM} coefficients suggest that one degree Celsius increase in habitat is associated with an average 3.5\% increase in natural mortality (including a 1.4\% indirect impact that acts via temperature effects on the growth coefficient), and an average 3.0\% decrease in fecundity (via indirect impacts on maximum age and length). Cross-validation indicates that the model explains 54\%â€“89\% of variance for withheld measurements of continuous traits and has an area under the receiver-operator-characteristics curve of 0.86â€“0.99 for categorical traits. We use imputed traits to classify all fishes into life-history types, and confirm a phylogenetic signal in three dominant life-history strategies in fishes. {PTI} using phylogenetic {SEMs} ensures that estimated parameters are interpretable as regression slopes, such that the inferred evolutionary relationships can be compared with long-term evolutionary and rearing experiments.},

	abstract = {Fishery-independent surveys, such as bottom trawl surveys, provide time-series abundance estimates, which inform many modern stock assessments. Area-swept biomass estimates from trawl surveys assume that fish densities do not differ between trawlable (T) and untrawlable ({UT}) areas. Bias and imprecision in the biomass estimates can occur when this assumption is not met. Thus, reliable estimates are needed for both the extent of T and {UT} habitat types in the surveyed area, and the relative densities of the fish species in the two habitat types to accurately assess groundfish populations. Acoustics and stereo-camera survey tools were used in the present study to determine the extent of T and {UT} habitat within 25-km2 bottom trawl survey grid cells historically designated as T/{UT}. Splitbeam acoustics were used to compare the abundance of rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) between the T/{UT} grid cell areas. Acoustic data were collected along uniformly spaced transects within 52 T and 43 {UT} grid cells throughout the Gulf of Alaska during summers 2013, 2015, and 2017. The acoustic backscatter attributed to rockfishes in {UT} grid cells was approximately three times that in T cells, and the percentages available to the bottom trawl survey were 40 \% for harlequin rockfish, 43 \% for northern rockfish, 51 \% for dusky rockfish, and 98 \% for Pacific ocean perch ({POP}). These findings allowed for estimation of the trawl catchability coefficient (q; a scaler between estimates of the area-swept survey abundance and actual abundance) of 0.46 for harlequin rockfish, 0.50 for northern rockfish, and 0.64 for dusky rockfish, and 1.15 for {POP}. These values could be used to inform the relationship between trawl survey estimated and actual abundances of rockfishes to improve the accuracy of stock assessments for these species.},
