# Data

> Operational Update: The data description for Flathead sole-Bering flounder has been truncated to highlight relevant updates or changes made for this cycle. The reader is referred to the last full assessment [@Monnahan2020] for the entirety of this section. 

The following table summarizes the data used for this assessment.

```{r}

                      rep("U.S. trawl fishery", 3)),

## Fishery

Catches as used in the model are shown in Table \@ref(tab:commcatch); discards are not used in the model. Fishery-dependent compositional data (catch-at-length and catch-at-age, and associated input sample sizes) are shown in Tables \@ref(tab:fishlengthcompst) and \@ref(tab:fishagecompst), respectively.

## Survey

Survey biomass estimates and associated sampling variability (annual CVs) are shown in Table \@ref(tab:survobs). Suvey compositional data (survey conditional ages-at-length, and associated input sample sizes) are shown in Table \@ref(tab:survagecompst).
