# Data

> Operational Update: The data description for Flathead sole-Bering flounder has been truncated to highlight relevant updates or changes made for this cycle. The reader is referred to the last full assessment [@Monnahan2020] for the entirety of this section. 

The following table summarizes the data used for this assessment.

## Fishery

Catches as used in the model are shown in Table \@ref(tab:commcatch); discards are not used in the model. Fishery-dependent compositional data (catch-at-length and catch-at-age, and associated input sample sizes) are shown in Tables \@ref(tab:fishlengthcompstF) through \@ref(tab:fishagecompstM).

## Survey

Survey biomass estimates and associated sampling variability (annual CVs) are shown in Table \@ref(tab:survobs). Survey length compositional data are shown in Tables \@ref(tab:survlengthcompstF) and \@ref(tab:survlengthcompstM). Survey conditional age-at-length data is prohibitively large to present in this document; readers may access these data electronically [here](https://github.com/afsc-assessments/bsai-fhs/blob/bafa7658d31e0b99fe11d626a58e1c01807c69ee/2024/mgmt/18.2c_2024/2020_BSAI_FHS.dat#L277).
