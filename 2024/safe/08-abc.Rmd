### Amendment 56 Reference Points

This stock complex is managed under Tier 3a of Amendment 56. The following table shows the reference points calculated for the `r year` assessment.

| Reference Point | Description                                                                                                                                                | Value   |

| OFL             | Yield at $F_{35\%}$  in `r year+1` | `r prettyNum(ofl_25,big.mark =',')` t  |

### Specification of OFL and Maximum Permissible ABC {#oflabc}

#### Standard Harvest Scenarios (Harvest Projections) {#harvestprojections}

We used the `spm` projection software, downloaded and compiled on 04 April 2024.

A standard set of projections is required for each stock managed under Tier 3 of Amendment 56. Five of the seven standard scenarios support the alternative harvest strategies analyzed in the Alaska Groundfish Harvest Specifications Final Environmental Impact Statement. They are as follows (“max$F_{ABC}$” refers to the maximum permissible value of $F_{ABC}$ under Amendment 56):

+   *Scenario 1*:  In all future years, $F$ is set equal to max$F_{ABC}$ (Rationale:  Historically, TAC has been constrained by ABC, so this scenario provides a likely upper limit on future TACs.)

+   *Scenario 2*: The exact calculation of these values is shown [below](#authorsF).

+   *Scenario 3*:  In all future years, $F$ is set equal to 50% of max $F_{ABC}$. (Rationale:  This scenario provides a lower bound on $F_{ABC}$ that still allows future harvest rates to be adjusted downward when stocks fall below reference levels.)

+   *Scenario 4*:  In all future years, $F$ is set equal to the `r paste0(range(year-6, year-2), collapse='-')` average F. (Rationale:  For some stocks, TAC can be well below ABC, and recent average $F$ may provide a better indicator of FTAC than $F_{ABC}$.)

+   *Scenario 5*:  In all future years, $F$ is set equal to zero. (Rationale:  In extreme cases, TAC may be set at a level close to zero.)

Two other scenarios are needed to satisfy the MSFCMA’s requirement to determine whether a stock is currently in an overfished condition or is approaching an overfished condition. These two scenarios are as follows (for Tier 3 stocks, the MSY level is defined as $B_{35\%}$): 

+   *Scenario 6*:  In all future years, $F$ is set equal to $F_{OFL}$. (Rationale:  This scenario determines whether a stock is overfished. If the stock is expected to be above 1) above its MSY level in `r year` or 2) above ½ of its MSY level in  `r year` and above its MSY level in  `r year+10` under this scenario, then the stock is not overfished.) While Scenario 6 gives the best estimate of OFL for `r year`, it does not provide the best estimate of OFL for `r year + 1`, because the mean `r year` catch under Scenario 6 is predicated on the `r year` catch being equal to the `r year` OFL, whereas the actual `r year` catch will likely be less than the `r year` OFL. The executive summary contains the appropriate one- and two-year ahead projections for both ABC and OFL.

+   *Scenario 7*:  In `r year+1` and `r year+2`, $F$ is set equal to max$F_{ABC}$, and in all subsequent years $F$ is set equal to $F_{OFL}$. (Rationale: This scenario determines whether a stock is approaching an overfished condition. If the stock is 1) above its MSY level in `r year+2` or 2) above 1/2 of its *MSY* level in `r year+2` and expected to be above its MSY level in `r year+12` under this scenario, then the stock is not approaching an overfished condition.)


#### How Future Catches are Specified for Scenario 2 (Author's F) {#authorsF}

> The method for specifying catches in years `r year` to `r year+2` has not changed from the 2020 assessment. 

For Scenario 2 (*Author's F*); we use pre-specified catches to increase accuracy of short-term projections in fisheries where the catch is usually less than the ABC. We specify `r year` catches as the most current observed catches plus the typical (5-year average) landings through the present date through the end of the calendar year, and the catches for years `r year+1` and `r year+2` as the average catch from `r year-5` to `r year-1`, which is `r prettyNum(c2,big.mark=',')` t.

Projected catches, spawning biomass, and fishing mortality rates corresponding to the alternative harvest scenarios over a 13-year period are shown in Tables 9-\@ref(tab:projectionsCatches) through 9-\@ref(tab:projectionsF).
 
## Risk Table and ABC recommendation {#risktable}

The risk table scoring for BSAI FHS has not changed since 2020.

data.frame(assess = l1,
           pop = l1,
           enviro = l1,
           fish = l1) %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
    width(j = ~ assess, width = 1.5) %>% 
    width(j = ~ pop, width = 1.5) %>% 
    width(j = ~ enviro, width = 1.5) %>%

```

An abridged summary of the considerations that led to this determination for each category follows.

### Assessment considerations {#assessmentconsiderations}

Overall, the model fits all the data sets very well. Both the survey index, and survey and fishery composition data show no concerning patterns. All parameters were well estimated, without any convergence issues. Adding the new data had a minimal impact on estimated parameters and management quantities, corroborating the general stability of the model found in previous assessments. 
*We therefore conclude there are no increased concerns and set this consideration at level 1.*

### Population dynamics considerations

The spawning stock biomass has been above target for the entire time period for which there are data. It is projected to increase into the near future (based on the Scenario 4 projection above) as there was a series of above-average recruitments from 2015-2020 that continue to mature. This increase is already borne out in the estimated age 3+ biomass (Figure 9-\@ref(fig:biofreccompare)) and observed index (Figure 9-\@ref(fig:survey)), both of which show a general increase since 2015. *Since we have no increased concerns we set the concern level to 1.*

### Environmental/Ecosystem considerations
 
*Environmental processes*: The eastern Bering Sea (EBS) experienced a prolonged period of above-average thermal conditions from 2014 through 2021. Since 2021, and continuing from August 2023–August 2024, thermal conditions in the EBS have been close to historical baselines of many metrics. There have been no sustained marine heatwaves over the southeastern or northern Bering Sea shelves since January 2021 (Callahan and Lemagie, 2024), and observed (Rohan and Barnett, 2024) modeled (Kearney, 2024) EBS bottom temperatures were mostly near-normal over the past year. Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and bottom temperatures were near the long-term means in all regions by summer 2024. Notable deviations include (i) warm SSTs in the outer domain from fall 2023 through spring 2024 and (ii) unusually warm bottom temperatures in the northern outer domain since spring 2024 that may indicate an intrusion of shelf water (Callahan et al., 2024).
Atmospheric conditions are one of the primary drivers that impact the oceanographic setting in the EBS. Both the North Pacific Index (NPI) and Aleutian Low Index (ALI) provide complementary views of the atmospheric pressure system in the North Pacific. During winter 2023-2024, the NPI was average (Siddon, 2024) and the strength and location of the Aleutian Low Pressure System were both near climatological averages (Overland and Wang, 2024). Thus, despite delayed formation of sea ice in fall 2023 (Thoman, 2024), cold winds from the Arctic helped advance sea ice to near-normal extent by mid-winter. Near-normal sea ice extent and thickness (Thoman, 2024b, 2024c) may have contributed to a cold pool (<2°C water) of average spatial extent (Siddon, 2024), though the footprint of the coldest waters (<0°C) in 2024 was 75% smaller than in 2023 (Rohan and Barnett, 2024b). 
FHS is a winter-spawning flatfish; increased young-of-the-year recruitment is correlated to years with onshore winds during the larval period. The along- and cross-slope wind components along the Bering shelf break may be informative to understanding the larval dispersal in the upper ocean. December 2023 had significant along-shelf winds (to the southeast) that could have driven offshore Ekman transport. Weaker, but more sustained winds that also favored offshore transport occurred from March to May 2024 (Hennon, 2024), which overlaps with the FHS larval period. In the 2024 bottom trawl survey, FHS biomass increased 22% from 2023 to 2024 while abundance increased 13%.
For projections into 2025, the National Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) predicts that SSTs over the EBS are expected to be near normal (anomalies within <0.5°C of the 1982–2010 baseline) (Lemagie, 2024). With the expected transition to La Niña, cooler conditions in the EBS may follow. Relatively cool SSTs may contribute to earlier formation of sea ice than has been observed over the last several years (Thoman, 2024b).
Metrics of ocean acidification include $\Omega$arag and pH. Summer 2024 bottom water $\Omega$arag conditions were similar to 2023 while pH was slightly more acidic; the most corrosive bottom waters were found in slope waters and over the northwest shelf (Pilcher et al., 2024). 


*Prey*: Prey resources for adult FHS and Bering flounder include brittle stars (echinoderms), polychaetes, and crustaceans as well as juvenile walleye pollock. Trends in motile epifauna biomass indicate benthic productivity, although individual species and/or taxa may reflect varying time scales of productivity. The biomass of motile epifauna increased from 2023 to 2024 and remains above the long term mean (Siddon, 2024). No direct or indirect measures of prey availability exist for the northern Bering Sea shelf. 
The estimated abundance of larval pollock sampled in spring increased from near the end of the last cold stanza (2012) through the warm stanza (2014, 2016, 2018) to a time-series maximum in 2024 (Rogers et al., 2024). By late summer, age-0 pollock CPUE estimates in the middle domain of the SEBS and NBS regions were lower than estimates from the recent warm period (2014–2021) but slightly higher than estimates from the cold period (2007–2013). In the inner domain, pollock were the most numerous non-salmonid species collected in the ADF&G nearshore survey (Garcia et al., 2024). In the NBS, CPUE estimates have remained low compared to the SEBS (Andrews et al., 2024). Since 2022, with cooler SSTs, pollock weights and energy density have been low while % lipid has been average (Page et al., 2024).
The condition of FHS (as measured by length-weight residuals) over the SEBS remains near average (Prohaska et al., 2024), indicating sufficient prey may be available.

*Competitors*: Competitors of FHS prey resources include other benthic foragers, like northern rock sole and yellowfin sole. The trend in biomass of the benthic foragers guild from the standard bottom trawl survey grid increased from 2023 to 2024. Flathead sole, northern rock sole, and yellowfin sole all contributed to the increase. However, both NRS and YFS remain below their long term means and the guild remains below the time series mean. Trends in benthic forager biomass indirectly indicate availability of infauna (i.e., prey of these species), suggesting competition for prey resources remains low in 2024 (Siddon, 2024).


*Predators*: Predators of FHS include Pacific Cod, Arrowtooth flounder, Greenland turbot, halibut, and pollock. In terms of predation pressure on FHS, we focus on biomass trends over the southern Bering Sea shelf. The biomass within the apex predator guild (including Pacific cod, Arrowtooth flounder, Greenland turbot, and halibut) measured during the standard bottom trawl survey in 2024 was nearly equal to their value in 2023 and below their long term mean (Siddon, 2024). Within that guild, Pacific cod and Pacific halibut biomass declined while arrowtooth flounder increased 26% from 2023 to 2024 (Siddon, 2024). Pollock biomass in the EBS increased substantially from 2023 to 2024 (78% increase of pollock in the pelagic forager guild; Siddon, 2024), largely as a result of the 2018 year class. Taken together, trends in competitors indicate potentially increased predation pressure for FHS. 

*Summary for Environmental/Ecosystem considerations*: 
**Environment**: The EBS shelf experienced oceanographic conditions that were largely average based on historical time series of multiple metrics over the past year (August 2023 - August 2024). The cold pool was average in extent over the shelf. Winds favored offshore Ekman transport from March through May that may have hindered transport to suitable nearshore nursery habitat. 
**Prey**: Indicators of prey availability suggest sufficient prey may have been available for FHS-Bering flounder.
Competition: Trends in potential competitors indicate competition for prey resources remains low in 2024.
**Predation**: Trends in competitors indicate potentially increased predation pressure for FHS-Bering flounder.

*Together, the most recent data available suggest an ecosystem risk Level 1 – Normal: “No apparent ecosystem concerns related to biological status (e.g., environment, prey, competition, predation), or minor concerns with uncertain impacts on the stock.”*

### Fishery performance

There is no ESP for this stock complex, but we note that the fishery has consistently caught only a small fraction of the ABC (averaging less than 20% over the last five years). We did not examine CPUE trends nor spatial patterns of fishing. There are no changes in the duration of fishing openings. *Altogether, we see no cause for concern and give this consideration a level 1 as well.* 

 
### Risk Table Summary and ABC recommendation

*Since we rated all four considerations at level 1, we do not believe a reduction from $max_{ABC}$ is warranted.*

## Status Determination

> The status definitions under the MSFCMA have been truncated from this report. 

### Overfishing  
The official catch estimate for the most recent complete year (`r year-1`) is `r prettyNum(c0,big.mark=",")` t. This is less than the `r year-1` OFL of `r prettyNum(ofl_23_23,big.mark=",")` t. *The stock is not subject to overfishing.*

### Overfished (Harvest Scenario 6) 

The minimum stock size threshold (MSST) for BSAI FHS is given by $B_{35\%}$ which is `r prettyNum(round(b35_25),big.mark=",")` in `r year`. The estimated stock spawning biomass in `r year` is more than double the MSST at `r prettyNum(ssb_25,big.mark=",")`. *The stock is not overfished*.

### Approaching Overfished (Harvest Scenario 7)
The mean estimated stock spawning biomass in `r year+13` under Harvest Scenario 7 is greater than $B_{35\%}$ (Table 9-\@ref(tab:projectionsSsb)). *The stock is not approaching an overfished state*.

 
The $F$ using `r model_name` that would have produced a catch for `r year-1` equal to the OFL specified in `r year-1` for `r year-1` (`r prettyNum(ofl_23_23, big.mark = ',')`) was `r f_best`.
