### Specification of OFL and Maximum Permissible ABC {#oflabc}

#### Standard Harvest Scenarios (Harvest Projections) {#harvestprojections}

We used the `spm` projection software, downloaded and compiled on 04 April 2024.

A standard set of projections is required for each stock managed under Tier 3 of Amendment 56. Five of the seven standard scenarios support the alternative harvest strategies analyzed in the Alaska Groundfish Harvest Specifications Final Environmental Impact Statement. They are as follows (“max$F_{ABC}$” refers to the maximum permissible value of $F_{ABC}$ under Amendment 56):

+   *Scenario 1*:  In all future years, $F$ is set equal to max$F_{ABC}$ (Rationale:  Historically, TAC has been constrained by ABC, so this scenario provides a likely upper limit on future TACs.)

+   *Scenario 2*: The exact calculation of these values is shown [below](#authorsF).

+   *Scenario 3*:  In all future years, $F$ is set equal to 50% of max $F_{ABC}$. (Rationale:  This scenario provides a lower bound on $F_{ABC}$ that still allows future harvest rates to be adjusted downward when stocks fall below reference levels.)

+   *Scenario 4*:  In all future years, $F$ is set equal to the `r paste0(range(year-6, year-2), collapse='-')` average F. (Rationale:  For some stocks, TAC can be well below ABC, and recent average $F$ may provide a better indicator of FTAC than $F_{ABC}$.)

+   *Scenario 5*:  In all future years, $F$ is set equal to zero. (Rationale:  In extreme cases, TAC may be set at a level close to zero.)

Two other scenarios are needed to satisfy the MSFCMA’s requirement to determine whether a stock is currently in an overfished condition or is approaching an overfished condition. These two scenarios are as follows (for Tier 3 stocks, the MSY level is defined as $B_{35\%}$): 

+   *Scenario 6*:  In all future years, $F$ is set equal to $F_{OFL}$. (Rationale:  This scenario determines whether a stock is overfished. If the stock is expected to be above 1) above its MSY level in `r year` or 2) above ½ of its MSY level in  `r year` and above its MSY level in  `r year+10` under this scenario, then the stock is not overfished.) While Scenario 6 gives the best estimate of OFL for `r year`, it does not provide the best estimate of OFL for `r year + 1`, because the mean `r year` catch under Scenario 6 is predicated on the `r year` catch being equal to the `r year` OFL, whereas the actual `r year` catch will likely be less than the `r year` OFL. The executive summary contains the appropriate one- and two-year ahead projections for both ABC and OFL.

+   *Scenario 7*:  In `r year+1` and `r year+2`, $F$ is set equal to max$F_{ABC}$, and in all subsequent years $F$ is set equal to $F_{OFL}$. (Rationale: This scenario determines whether a stock is approaching an overfished condition. If the stock is 1) above its MSY level in `r year+2` or 2) above 1/2 of its *MSY* level in `r year+2` and expected to be above its MSY level in `r year+12` under this scenario, then the stock is not approaching an overfished condition.)


#### How Future Catches are Specified for Scenario 2 (Author's F) {#authorsF}

> The method for specifying catches in years `r year` to `r year+2` has not changed from the 2020 assessment. 

For Scenario 2 (*Author's F*); we use pre-specified catches to increase accuracy of short-term projections in fisheries where the catch is usually less than the ABC. We specify `r year` catches as the most current observed catches plus the typical (5-year average) landings through the present date through the end of the calendar year, and the catches for years `r year+1` and `r year+2` as the average catch from `r year-5` to `r year-1`, which is `r prettyNum(c2,big.mark=',')` t.

Projected catches, spawning biomass, and fishing mortality rates corresponding to the alternative harvest scenarios over a 13-year period are shown in Tables 9-\@ref(tab:projectionsCatches) through 9-\@ref(tab:projectionsF).
 
## Risk Table and ABC recommendation {#risktable}

The risk table scoring for BSAI FHS has not changed since 2020.

```{r}
l1 = "Level 1: No concern"
l2 = "Level 2: Major concern"
l3 = "Level 3: Extreme concern" 
require(flextable)
data.frame(assess = l1,
           pop = l1,
           enviro = l1,
           fish = l1) %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
    width(j = ~ assess, width = 1.5) %>% 
    width(j = ~ pop, width = 1.5) %>% 
    width(j = ~ enviro, width = 1.5) %>% 
    width(j = ~ fish, width = 1.5) %>% 
    flextable::set_header_labels(level = "",
                    assess = "Assessment-related considerations",
                    pop = "Population dynamics considerations",
                    enviro = "Environmental/ecosystem considerations",
                    fish = "Fishery Performance") %>% 
  flextable::fontsize(size = 10) %>% 
  font(fontname = "Times", part = "all") %>%
    italic(part ='header')
```

An abridged summary of the considerations that led to this determination for each category follows.

### Assessment considerations {#assessmentconsiderations}

Overall, the model fits all the data sets very well. Both the survey index, and survey and fishery composition data show no concerning patterns. All parameters were well estimated, without any convergence issues. Adding the new data had a minimal impact on estimated parameters and management quantities, corroborating the general stability of the model found in previous assessments. 
*We therefore conclude there are no increased concerns and set this consideration at level 1.*

### Population dynamics considerations

The spawning stock biomass has been above target for the entire time period for which there are data. It is projected to increase into the near future (based on the Scenario 4 projection above) as there was a series of above-average recruitments from 2015-2020 that continue to mature. This increase is already borne out in the estimated age 3+ biomass (Figure 9-\@ref(fig:biofreccompare)) and observed index (Figure 9-\@ref(fig:survey)), both of which show a general increase since 2015. *Since we have no increased concerns we set the concern level to 1.*

### Environmental/Ecosystem considerations
 
*Summary for Environmental/Ecosystem considerations*:
This is a summary of details provided by the 

**Environment**: The EBS shelf experienced oceanographic conditions that were largely average based on historical time series of multiple metrics over the past year (August 2023 - August 2024). The cold pool was average in extent over the shelf. Winds favored offshore Ekman transport from March through May that may have hindered transport to suitable nearshore nursery habitat. 
**Prey**: Indicators of prey availability suggest sufficient prey may have been available for FHS-Bering flounder.
Competition: Trends in potential competitors indicate competition for prey resources remains low in 2024.
**Predation**: Trends in competitors indicate potentially increased predation pressure for FHS-Bering flounder.

*Together, the most recent data available suggest an ecosystem risk Level 1 – Normal: “No apparent ecosystem concerns related to biological status (e.g., environment, prey, competition, predation), or minor concerns with uncertain impacts on the stock.”*
 
### Fishery performance

There is no ESP for this stock complex, but we note that the fishery has consistently caught only a small fraction of the ABC (averaging less than 20% over the last five years). We did not examine CPUE trends nor spatial patterns of fishing. There are no changes in the duration of fishing openings. *Altogether, we see no cause for concern and give this consideration a level 1 as well.* 

 
### Risk Table Summary and ABC recommendation

*Since we rated all four considerations at level 1, we do not believe a reduction from $max_{ABC}$ is warranted.*

## Status Determination

> The status definitions under the MSFCMA have been truncated from this report. 

### Overfishing  
The official catch estimate for the most recent complete year (`r year-1`) is `r prettyNum(c0,big.mark=",")` t. This is less than the `r year-1` OFL of `r prettyNum(ofl_23_23,big.mark=",")` t. *The stock is not subject to overfishing.*

### Overfished (Harvest Scenario 6) 

The minimum stock size threshold (MSST) for BSAI FHS is given by $B_{35\%}$ which is `r prettyNum(round(b35_25),big.mark=",")` in `r year`. The estimated stock spawning biomass in `r year` is more than double the MSST at `r prettyNum(ssb_25,big.mark=",")`. *The stock is not overfished*.

### Approaching Overfished (Harvest Scenario 7)
The mean estimated stock spawning biomass in `r year+13` under Harvest Scenario 7 is greater than $B_{35\%}$ (Table 9-\@ref(tab:projectionsSsb)). *The stock is not approaching an overfished state*.

 
The $F$ using `r model_name` that would have produced a catch for `r year-1` equal to the OFL specified in `r year-1` for `r year-1` (`r prettyNum(ofl_23_23, big.mark = ',')`) was `r f_best`.
