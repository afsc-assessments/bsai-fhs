### Specification of OFL and Maximum Permissible ABC {#oflabc}

#### Standard Harvest Scenarios (Harvest Projections) {#harvestprojections}

**UPDATE THIS SECTION GIVEN PROJ TEAM GUIDANCE**

A standard set of projections is required for each stock managed under Tier 3 of Amendment 56. Five of the seven standard scenarios support the alternative harvest strategies analyzed in the Alaska Groundfish Harvest Specifications Final Environmental Impact Statement. They are as follows (“max$F_{ABC}$” refers to the maximum permissible value of $F_{ABC}$ under Amendment 56):

+   *Scenario 1*:  In all future years, $F$ is set equal to max$F_{ABC}$ (Rationale:  Historically, TAC has been constrained by ABC, so this scenario provides a likely upper limit on future TACs.)

+   *Scenario 2*: The exact calculation of these values is shown [below](#authorsF).

+   *Scenario 3*:  In all future years, $F$ is set equal to 50% of max $F_{ABC}$. (Rationale:  This scenario provides a lower bound on $F_{ABC}$ that still allows future harvest rates to be adjusted downward when stocks fall below reference levels.)

+   *Scenario 4*:  In all future years, $F$ is set equal to the `r paste0(range(year-6, year-2), collapse='-')` average F. (Rationale:  For some stocks, TAC can be well below ABC, and recent average $F$ may provide a better indicator of FTAC than $F_{ABC}$.)

+   *Scenario 5*:  In all future years, $F$ is set equal to zero. (Rationale:  In extreme cases, TAC may be set at a level close to zero.)

Two other scenarios are needed to satisfy the MSFCMA’s requirement to determine whether a stock is currently in an overfished condition or is approaching an overfished condition. These two scenarios are as follows (for Tier 3 stocks, the MSY level is defined as $B_{35\%}$): 

+   *Scenario 6*:  In all future years, $F$ is set equal to $F_{OFL}$. (Rationale:  This scenario determines whether a stock is overfished. If the stock is expected to be above 1) above its MSY level in `r year` or 2) above ½ of its MSY level in  `r year` and above its MSY level in  `r year+10` under this scenario, then the stock is not overfished.) While Scenario 6 gives the best estimate of OFL for `r year`, it does not provide the best estimate of OFL for `r year + 1`, because the mean `r year` catch under Scenario 6 is predicated on the `r year` catch being equal to the `r year` OFL, whereas the actual `r year` catch will likely be less than the `r year` OFL. The executive summary contains the appropriate one- and two-year ahead projections for both ABC and OFL.

+   *Scenario 7*:  In `r year+1` and `r year+2`, $F$ is set equal to max$F_{ABC}$, and in all subsequent years $F$ is set equal to $F_{OFL}$. (Rationale: This scenario determines whether a stock is approaching an overfished condition. If the stock is 1) above its MSY level in `r year+2` or 2) above 1/2 of its *MSY* level in `r year+2` and expected to be above its MSY level in `r year+12` under this scenario, then the stock is not approaching an overfished condition.)


#### How Future Catches are Specified for Scenario 2 (Author's F) {#authorsF}

> The method for specifying catches in years `r year` to `r year+2` has not changed from the 2020 assessment. 

For Scenario 2 (*Author's F*); we use pre-specified catches to increase accuracy of short-term projections in fisheries where the catch is usually less than the ABC. We specify `r year` catches as the most current observed catches plus the typical landings through the present date through the end of the calendar year, and the catches for years `r year+1` and `r year+2` as the average catch from `r year-5` to `r year-1`, which is `r prettyNum(c2,big.mark=',')` t.

Projected catches, spawning biomass, and fishing mortality rates corresponding to the alternative harvest scenarios over a 13-year period are shown in Tables \@ref(tab:projectionsCatches) through \@ref(tab:projectionsF).
 
## Risk Table and ABC recommendation {#risktable}

**CONFIRM THAT WE DO NOT NEED TO INCLUDE THE RISK TABLE DEFINITIONS AND EXAMPLE TEXT**

The risk table scoring for BSAI FHS has not changed since 2020, with the exception that the SSC requested that the number of Risk Table categories (i.e., levels of concern) be reduced from four to three. Per leadership instruction in 2023, we have consolidated what were previously categories 2 and 3 ("substantially increased" and "major concern" into a single category, "increased/major concern"). This does not affect any of the category scores, which were and are level 1.

```{r}
l1 = "Level 1: No concern"
l2 = "Level 2: Major concern"
l3 = "Level 3: Extreme concern" 
require(flextable)
data.frame(assess = l1,
           pop = l1,
           enviro = l1,
           fish = l1) %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
    width(j = ~ assess, width = 1.5) %>% 
    width(j = ~ pop, width = 1.5) %>% 
    width(j = ~ enviro, width = 1.5) %>% 
    width(j = ~ fish, width = 1.5) %>% 
    flextable::set_header_labels(level = "",
                    assess = "Assessment-related considerations",
                    pop = "Population dynamics considerations",
                    enviro = "Environmental/ecosystem considerations",
                    fish = "Fishery Performance") %>% 
  flextable::fontsize(size = 10) %>% 
  font(fontname = "Times", part = "all") %>%
    italic(part ='header')
```

An abridged summary of the considerations that led to this determination for each category follows.

### Assessment considerations {#assessmentconsiderations}

Overall, the model fits all the data sets very well. Both the survey index, and survey and fishery composition data show no concerning patterns. All parameters were well estimated, without any convergence issues. Adding the new data had a minimal impact on estimated parameters and management quantities, corroborating the general stability of the model found in previous assessments. 
*We therefore conclude there are no increased concerns and set this consideration at level 1.*

### Population dynamics considerations

The spawning stock biomass has been above target for the entire time period for which there are data. It is projected to increase into the near future (based on the Scenario 4 projection above) as there was a series of above-average recruitments from 2015-2020 that continue to mature. This increase is already borne out in the estimated age 3+ biomass (Figure \@ref(fig:biofreccompare)) and observed index (Figure \@ref(fig:survey)), both of which show a general increase since 2015. *Since we have no increased concerns we set the concern level to 1.*

### Environmental/Ecosystem considerations

**UPDATE FOR 2024**

*Environmental processes*: Following two years of physical oceanographic perturbations, the eastern Bering Sea experienced a return to near-normal climatic conditions in 2020. Summer bottom temperatures and spatial extent of the cold pool were average based on the ROMS hindcast model and observations from the 2020 Dyson cruise. However, summer sea surface temperatures through August were above average in the southern and northern Bering Sea, similar to those observed in 2019 (Siddon, 2020). 

Based on the OSCURS model, the 2020 springtime drift pattern was mixed, with an early period of favorable winds consistent with eastward drift followed by a period of unfavorable winds consistent with westward drift (Cooper and Wilderbuer, 2020). This drift pattern appears consistent with years when below-average recruitment occurred for flathead sole (FHS). 

*Prey*: The 2020 springtime drift pattern likely retained FHS larvae over the southern middle domain (Cooper and Widerbuer, 2020). In that region, the 2020 spring bloom timing occurred about a week earlier than the long-term mean while production was below the long-term mean (Nielsen et al., 2020). Depending on the spatial and temporal overlap between larvae and available primary production, this can result in a match or mismatch with favorable feeding conditions. Prey resources for adult FHS and Bering flounder include brittle stars (echinoderms), polychaetes, and crustaceans as well as juvenile walleye pollock. Trends in the abundance of motile epifauna remained above the long-term mean in 2019, although decreased 10% from 2018 (Whitehouse, 2019). This indicates sufficient prey availability for adult FHS over the southern Bering Sea shelf. Recent years of pollock recruitment were low, but the 2018 year class appears strong (as age-1 in 2019 assessment; Ianelli et al., 2019), therefore juvenile pollock may have been an available prey resource for FHS and Bering flounder. 

In 2019, FHS condition (as measured by weighted length-weight residuals) was near the historical average over the SEBS shelf with positive residuals over the southern portion of the bottom trawl survey area (strata 10, 30, and 50) and negative residuals over the northwest region (strata 40 and 40) (Rohan and Laman, 2020). 

*Predators*: Predators of FHS include Pacific Cod, pollock, arrowtooth flounder, Greenland turbot, and halibut. In terms of predation pressure on FHS, we focus on biomass trends over the southern Bering Sea shelf. The biomass within the apex predator guild (including Pacific cod, arrowtooth flounder, Greenland turbot, and halibut) increased slightly (2%) from 2018 to 2019 and remains at the long term mean (Whitehouse, 2019). Pacific cod and arrowtooth flounder are the biomass-dominant components of the guild. Pacific cod biomass has decreased since 2015 and is below its long term mean. In 2019, the biomass of Pacific cod in the standard bottom trawl survey area increased slightly (2%) while the abundance increased dramatically (112%) from 2018. This indicates strong recruitment of age-1 fish. Depending on the eventual year class strength of the 2018 Pacific cod cohort, this could present increased predation risk to FHS in the future. arrowtooth flounder biomass increased 13% from 2018 to 2019.

The biomass of pelagic foragers, dominated by pollock, increased from 2018 to 2019, but remains below the long term mean (Whitehouse, 2019). However, the biomass of pollock increased 75% from 2018 and indicates movement of adult pollock into the region that could present predation risk to FHS (Ianelli et al., 2019). 
Competitors for FHS prey resources include other benthic foragers, like northern rock sole and yellowfin sole. The trend in biomass of the benthic foragers guild has been declining since approximately 2010 and remained below the long term mean in 2019 (Whitehouse, 2019), suggesting a reduction in prey competition that is supported by the positive length-weight residuals over the southern shelf (strata 10, 30, and 50).
*Together, the most recent data available suggest there are no apparent ecosystem concerns, although predation pressure may be rising – level 1.*


### Fishery performance

There is no ESP for this stock complex, but we note that the fishery has consistently caught only a small fraction of the ABC (averaging less than 20% over the last five years). We did not examine CPUE trends nor spatial patterns of fishing. There are no changes in the duration of fishing openings. *Altogether, we see no cause for concern and give this consideration a level 1 as well.* 
 
### Risk Table Summary and ABC recommendation

*Since we rated all four considerations at level 1, we do not believe a reduction from maxABC is warranted.*

## Status Determination

> The status definitions under the MSFCMA have been truncated from this report. 

#### Overfishing  
The official catch estimate for the most recent complete year (`r year-1`) is `r prettyNum(c0,big.mark=",")` t. This is less than the `r year-1` OFL of `r prettyNum(ofl_23_23,big.mark=",")` t. *The stock is not subject to overfishing.*

#### Overfished (Harvest Scenario 6) 

The minimum stock size threshold (MSST) for BSAI FHS is given by the $B_{35\%}$ which is `r prettyNum(b35_25,big.mark=",")` in `r year`. The estimated stock spawning biomass in `r year` is more than double the MSST of `r prettyNum(ssb_25,big.mark=",")`. *The stock is not overfished*.

#### Approaching Overfished (Harvest Scenario 7)
The mean estimated stock spawning biomass in `r year+13` under Harvest Scenario 7 is greater than $B_{35\%}$ (Tables \@ref(tab:projectionsSsb)). *The stock is not approaching an overfished state*.

 
The F that would have produced a catch for `r year-1` equal to the `r year-1` OFL for `r year-1` (`r prettyNum(ofl_23_23, big.mark = ',')`) was `r f_best`.
