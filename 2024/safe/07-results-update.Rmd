# Selected Model Results

> Operational Update: This section has been condensed to follow the newest guidelines for "Operational Update Assessments" to the best of the Authors' ability. A minimal set of figures and tables are provided here; links to electronic files for supplementary data (e.g., numbers-at-age from the base model) are included in-text.

The model used in this assessment is the same as the model accepted in 2020 (`r old_model_name`) with updated data and parameter priors. `r old_model_name` with data updated through `year` (presented as `r model_name`) generally results in reasonable fits to the data (see Figure), estimates biologically plausible parameters (see Tables), and produces consistent patterns in abundance compared to previous assessments (Figure \@ref(fig:biofreccompare)). 

## Model Evaluation

### Residual Analysis and Convergence Criteria

The model achieved convergence as defined by an invertible Hessian matrix and a low maximum gradient component (less than`1e-4`), was achieved using the `hess_step` function in ADMB. Time-series plots of observed and predicted values, and the time-series of recruitment deviations did not suggest unusual residual patterns, or different behavior than in previous assessments. The uncertainty around parameter estimates and related derived quantities were in line with previous models.

### Parameter Estimates and Parameter Uncertainty 

Table \@ref(tab:parposteriorst) lists all estimated parameters in `r model_name`. It includes the associated asymptotic standard error estimates or other statistical measures of uncertainty.  Time series of deviation parameters (fishing mortality rates $F$ and recruitment deviations from (`r paste0(mod18.2c_2024$startyr,'-',mod18.2c_2024$endyr)`)) are shown in Figures \@ref(fig:biofreccompare) and \@ref(fig:recdevs), respectively.

Table \@ref(tab:parposteriorst) shows the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of key parameters with corresponding 95% credible intervals given by the asymptotic uncertainty.  

### Time Series Results
*Definitions:* **Spawning biomass** is the estimated weight of mature females. **Total biomass** is the estimated weight of all FHS ages 3 and greater. **Recruitment** is measured as the number of age-zero individuals. **Fishing mortality** is the mortality at the age the fishery has fully selected the fish. 
Key results have been summarized in Table \@ref(tab:timeseriest). Model predictions generally fit the data well (Figures .\@ref(fig:catch) through 10.\@ref(fig:survey)). A comma-separated electronic file containing the estimated numbers-at-age is available at https://github.com/afsc-assessments/bsai-fhs/blob/main/2024/mgmt/18.2c_2024/natage.csv.

#### Biomass
Spawning biomass was at a low in `r mod18.2c_2024$timeseries[which.min(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$SpawnBio),'Yr']` of `r prettyNum(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries[which.min(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$SpawnBio),'SpawnBio'], big.mark = ',')` t, reached a peak in `r subset(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries,Yr > 1980)[which.max(subset(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries,Yr > 1980)$SpawnBio),'Yr']` of `r prettyNum(subset(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries,Yr > 1980)[which.max(subset(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries,Yr > 1980)$SpawnBio),'SpawnBio'], big.mark = ',')` t, slowly decreased through 2020 and recently increased to a current spawning biomass of `r prettyNum(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries[mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$Yr == year,'SpawnBio'], big.mark=',')` t in `r year` (Figure \@ref(fig:biofreccompare)). These trends correspond to a period of high recruitment from 1980-1990, a period low recruitment occurred from 2004-2010 (Figure \@ref(fig:recdevs)) and increasing survey observations since 2015 (Figure \@ref(fig:survey)). The survey data are fit well throughout the time series.

#### Fishing Mortality

Historical apical fishing mortality was between `r paste(round(range(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$F1[mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$Yr %in% 1978:1987]),3), collapse = ' and ')` for the historical period of foreign fleets and the joint venture fishery. The estimates of uncertainty in fishing mortality during this period are artificially small due to the absence of a stock-recruitment relationship. Fishing mortality reached a peak in `r  subset(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries,Yr %in% 1988:2007)[which.max(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$F1[mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$Yr %in% 1988:2007]),'Yr'] ` at `r round(subset(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries,Yr %in% 1988:2007)[which.max(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$F1[mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$Yr %in% 1988:2007]),'F1'],3)`, and remained between `r paste(round(range(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$F1[mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$Yr %in% 1991:2007]),3), collapse = ' and ')`in the 1990s and early 2000s. Fishing mortality reached another peak of approximately `r round(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries[which.max(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$F1),'F1'],3)` in `r  mod18.2c_2024$timeseries[which.max(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$F1),'Yr']`  and has  declined since then (Figure \@ref(fig:spr)).  

#### Selectivity
Figure \@ref(fig:selex) shows the estimated length-based fishery selectivity curves and estimated age-based survey selectivity curves for `r model_name`. Both fleets indicate that males are caught at smaller lengths than females.
  

The time-blocked fishery survey selectivity curves `r model_name` indicate selection of smaller fish of both sexes in the early period (1964-1987) versus the later period (1988-present). The early period is characterized by a paucity of compositional data (Figure \@ref(fig:data)). The survey data (beginning in 1982) do not suggest that length-at-age was distinct across these time periods. We also do not suspect that the growth curves of fish captured by the fishery, as the aggregate fits to fishery length data (Figure \@ref(fig:lengthcomps)) are satisfactory (despite the fact that data from many of those years were not included in the joint likelihood; only the survey data was used to inform growth parameters and variability in growth in the model).

#### Recruitment
Recruitment (as measured by age-0 fish) is moderately variable (Figure \@ref(fig:biofreccompare)).
A period of high recruitments occurred from 1980-1990, and a period low recruitments occurred from 2004-2010 (Figure \@ref(fig:recdevs)). The age-0 recruitment was fixed to equal mean recruitment for the most recent four years because too few flathead sole are observed at ages 0-3 to estimate recruitment reliably. 

Flathead sole do not seem to exhibit a stock-recruitment relationship because large recruitment has occurred during periods of high and low biomass (Figure \@ref(fig:biofreccompare) and Table \@ref(tab:timeseriest)).`r model_name` does not specify an explicit stock-recruitment relationship. The average annual recruitment (in numbers) spawned after 1976 is estimated to be `r prettyNum(round(1e-6*with(subset(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries, Yr %in% 1977:2024), mean(Recruit_0)),3), big.mark = ',')` million.

### Comparison to Previous Model

A comparison of key derived quantities from the base model and the most recent full assessment is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:biofreccompare).  Parameter estimates and likelihood functions have remained similar to `r old_model_name`, and the 95% credible intervals of the current parameter estimates encompass the `r old_model_name` medians (Figure \@ref(fig:biofreccompare) and Tables \@ref(tab:parposteriorst) and \@ref(tab:resultscompare)).
