# Selected Model Results

> Operational Update: This section has been condensed to follow the newest guidelines for "Operational Update Assessments" to the best of the Authors' ability. A minimal set of figures and tables are provided here; links to electronic files for supplementary data (e.g., numbers-at-age from the base model) are included in-text.

The model used in this assessment is the same as the model accepted in 2020 (`r old_model_name`) with updated data and parameter priors. Model `r old_model_name` with data updated through `year` generally results in reasonable fits to the data, estimates biologically plausible parameters, and produces consistent patterns in abundance compared to previous assessments. 

## Model Evaluation

### Residual Analysis and Convergence Criteria

The model achieved convergence as defined by an invertible Hessian matrix and a low maximum gradient component (less than`1e-4`) that was achieved using the `hess_step` function in ADMB. Time-series plots of observed and predicted values, and the time-series of recruitment deviations, did not suggest unusual residual patterns, or different behavior than in previous assessments. The uncertainty around parameter estimates (obtained via MCMC, see below) and related derived quantities were in line with previous models.

### Parameter Estimates and Parameter Uncertainty 

Table \@ref(tab:parposteriorst) lists all estimated parameters in the base model. It includes the associated asymptotic standard error estimates or other statistical measures of uncertainty.  Time series of deviation parameters (fishing mortality rates $F$ and recruitment deviations from (`r paste0(mod18.2c_2024$startyr,'-',mod18.2c_2024$endyr)`)) are shown in Figures \@ref(fig:biofreccompare) and \@ref(fig:recdevs), respectively.
 
From the MCMC chains described in [Model Uncertainty](#modeluncertainty), we summarize the posterior densities of key parameters for the recommended model using histograms (Figure \@ref(fig:hists)) and credible intervals (Table \@ref(tab:parposteriorst)). We also use these posterior distributions to show uncertainty around time series estimates of survey biomass (Figure \@ref(fig:survey)), total and spawning biomass, fully selected fishing mortality and recruitment (Figure \@ref(fig:biofreccompare)).

Table \@ref(tab:parposteriorst) shows the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of key parameters with corresponding 95% credible intervals from the MCMC analysis. In 2021, a comparison between standard deviations derived from the Hessian matrix and MCMC indicated that uncertainty estimates were similar for $q$, $M$, and $F_{40\%}$, but the MCMC standard deviations were larger for the estimates of female spawning biomass and ABC. These larger standard deviations indicate that these parameters are more uncertain than indicated by the Hessian approximation. The distributions of these parameters with the exception of natural mortality are slightly skewed with higher means than medians for current spawning biomass and ABC, indicating possibilities of higher biomass estimates (Figure \@ref(fig:biofreccompare)). 

### Time Series Results
*Definitions:* Spawning biomass is the estimated weight of mature females. Total biomass is the estimated weight of all POP age two and greater. Recruitment is measured as the number of age-2 POP. Fishing mortality is the mortality at the age the fishery has fully selected the fish. 

Key results have been summarized in Table  \@ref(tab:timeseriest). Model predictions generally fit the data well (Figures .\@ref(fig:catch) through 10.\@ref(fig:survey)). A comma-separated electronic file containing the estimated numbers-at-age is available at https://github.com/pete-hulson/goa_pop/blob/main/2023/mgmt/2020.1-2023/processed/naa.csv.

#### Biomass

Estimated total biomass gradually increased from a low near 85,000 t in 1980 to over 596,000 t at its peak in 2015 (Figure \@ref(fig:biofreccompare)).The recent estimates of spawning biomass are nearly at historical levels prior to the 1970s. Both trajectories show a rapid increase since 1992, which coincides with an increase in uncertainty.  MCMC credible intervals indicate that the historic low is reasonably certain while recent increases are less certain. Spawning biomass shows a similar trend (Figure \@ref(fig:biofreccompare)). This is consistent with uncertainty in catchability $q$ (Figure \@ref(fig:hists)), which informs the population scale after the onset of survey data in the later period. The high catchability for POP is supported by several empirical studies using line transect densities counted from a submersible compared to trawl survey densities (@Krieger1993, [$q$=2.1], @kriegersigler1996 [$q$=1.3], @jones_estimates_2021 [$q$=1.15]). Spawning biomass and age-2+ total biomass have increased in response to fitting the large trawl survey biomass estimates since 2013 (Table \@ref(tab:survobs), Figure \@ref(fig:survey)).

Age of 50% selection is 5 for the survey and between 7 and 9 years for the fishery (Figure \@ref(fig:selex)). Fish are fully selected by both the fishery and survey between ages 10 and 15. Current fishery selectivity is dome-shaped and with the addition of the recent time block after 2007 matches well with the ages caught by the fishery. Catchability is slightly lower (1.73) than the 2021 estimate (1.82). 


#### Fishing Mortality
Figure \@ref(fig:spr), the 'phase-plane' plot, compares fishing mortality relative to the target reference point $F_{OFL}$ ($F_{35}$%) and spawning biomass relative to the corresponding biomass reference point  $B_{OFL}$ ($B_{35}$%). It includes two years of projected $F$ and $B$. Fully-selected fishing mortality shows that fishing mortality has decreased dramatically from historic rates and has leveled out in the last decade (Figure \@ref(fig:biofreccompare)). The fishing mortality rate for POP has been below the $F_{40}$% and biomass has been above $B_{40}$% since the mid 1980s.

#### Selectivity
The estimated selectivity curves are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:selex). The descending limb of the second-to-last time block (ending in 2006) is somewhat more domed (lower values) than the previous model, but the curves are otherwise similar.

#### Recruitment

Recruitment (as measured by age-2 fish) for POP is highly variable and large recruitment events comprise much of the biomass for future years (Figure \@ref(fig:biofreccompare)). The model estimates that recruitment was below average from 1975-1985 (Figure \@ref(fig:recdevs)), after which it was above average for many years. The survey age data and the large survey biomass observations from 2013 onwards suggest that there were strong year classes in 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2018 (Figure \@ref(fig:recdevs)). However, these recent recruitment events are still uncertain as indicated by the MCMC credible intervals in Figure \@ref(fig:recdevs), some of which cross the zero (average) line. The high recruitment estimate of 2018 has been revised downwards from the 2021 assessment with the addition of survey and fishery ages through 2021 and 2022, respectively, and is now of a similar scale to earlier estimates.

POP do not seem to exhibit a stock-recruitment relationship because large recruitment has occurred during periods of high and low biomass (Figure \@ref(fig:biofreccompare) and Table \@ref(tab:timeseriest)). The POP model does not specify an explicit stock-recruitment relationship. The average annual recruitment (in numbers) spawned after 1976 is estimated to be `r prettyNum(round(exp(4.449),0), big.mark = ',')` million.

### Comparison to Previous Model

A comparison of key derived quantities from the base model and the most recent full assessment is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:biofreccompare).  Parameter estimates and likelihood functions have remained similar to the 2020 model, and the 95% credible intervals of the current parameter estimates encompass the 2020 medians (Figure \@ref(fig:biofreccompare) and Tables \@ref(tab:parposteriorst) and \@ref(tab:resultscompare)).
