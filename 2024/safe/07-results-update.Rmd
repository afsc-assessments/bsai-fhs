# Selected Model Results

> Operational Update: This section has been condensed to follow the newest guidelines for "Operational Update Assessments" to the best of the Authors' ability. A minimal set of figures and tables are provided here; links to electronic files for supplementary data (e.g., numbers-at-age from the base model) are included in-text.

The model used in this assessment is the same as the model accepted in 2020 (`r old_model_name`) with updated data and parameter priors. `r old_model_name` with data updated through `r year` (presented as `r model_name`) generally results in reasonable fits to the data (see Figures 9.\@ref(fig:survey) through 9.\@ref(fig:caalfit3)), estimates biologically plausible parameters (see Table 9.\@ref(tab:parposteriorst)), and produces consistent patterns in abundance compared to previous assessments (Figure 9.\@ref(fig:biofreccompare)).

## Time Series Results

*Definitions:*

-   **Spawning biomass** is the estimated weight of mature females, in t.

-   **Total biomass** is the estimated weight of all fish ages 3 and greater, in t.

-   **Recruitment** is measured as the number of age-zero individuals.

-   **Fishing mortality** is the mortality at the age the fishery has fully selected the fish.

Key results have been summarized in Table 9.\@ref(tab:timeseriest). Model predictions generally fit the data well (Figures 9.\@ref(fig:catch) through 9.\@ref(fig:survey)). A comma-separated electronic file containing the estimated numbers-at-age is available [here](https://github.com/afsc-assessments/bsai-fhs/blob/main/2024/mgmt/18.2c_2024/natage.csv).

### Biomass

Spawning biomass was at a low in `r mod18.2c_2024$timeseries[which.min(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$SpawnBio),'Yr']` of `r prettyNum(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries[which.min(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$SpawnBio),'SpawnBio'], big.mark = ',')` t, reached a peak in `r subset(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries,Yr > 1980)[which.max(subset(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries,Yr > 1980)$SpawnBio),'Yr']` of `r prettyNum(subset(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries,Yr > 1980)[which.max(subset(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries,Yr > 1980)$SpawnBio),'SpawnBio'], big.mark = ',')` t, slowly decreased through 2020 and recently increased to a current spawning biomass of `r prettyNum(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries[mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$Yr == year,'SpawnBio'], big.mark=',')` t in `r year` (Figure 9.\@ref(fig:biofreccompare)). These trends correspond to a period of high recruitment from 1980-1990, a period of low recruitment occurred from 2004-2010 (Figure 9.\@ref(fig:recdevs)) and increasing survey observations since 2015 (Figure 9.\@ref(fig:survey)). The survey data are fit well throughout the time series.

### Fishing Mortality

Historical apical fishing mortality was between `r paste(round(range(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$F1[mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$Yr %in% 1978:1987]),3), collapse = ' and ')` for the historical period of foreign fleets and the joint venture fishery. The estimates of uncertainty in fishing mortality during this period are artificially small due to the absence of a stock-recruitment relationship. Fishing mortality reached a peak in `r  subset(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries,Yr %in% 1988:2007)[which.max(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$F1[mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$Yr %in% 1988:2007]),'Yr']` at `r round(subset(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries,Yr %in% 1988:2007)[which.max(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$F1[mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$Yr %in% 1988:2007]),'F1'],3)`, and remained between `r paste(round(range(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$F1[mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$Yr %in% 1991:2007]),3), collapse = ' and ')` in the 1990s and early 2000s. Fishing mortality reached another peak of approximately `r round(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries[which.max(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$F1),'F1'],3)` in `r  mod18.2c_2024$timeseries[which.max(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries$F1),'Yr']` and has declined since then (Figure 9.\@ref(fig:spr)).

### Selectivity

Figure 9.\@ref(fig:selex) shows the estimated length-based fishery selectivity curves and estimated age-based survey selectivity curves for `r model_name`. The curves suggest that males are caught at smaller lengths than females for both fleets.

The time-blocked fishery survey selectivity curves `r model_name` indicate selection of smaller fish of both sexes in the early period (1964-1987) versus the later period (1988-present). The early period is characterized by a paucity of compositional data (Figure 9.\@ref(fig:data)). The survey data (beginning in 1982) do not suggest that length-at-age was distinct across these time periods. We also do not suspect that the growth curves of fish captured by the fishery vary through time, as the aggregate fits to fishery length data (Figure 9.\@ref(fig:lengthcomps)) are satisfactory. This is despite the fact that data from many of those years were not included in the joint likelihood; only the survey data was used to inform growth parameters and variability in growth in the model.

### Recruitment

Recruitment (as measured by age-0 fish) is moderately variable (Figure 9.\@ref(fig:biofreccompare)). A period of high recruitments occurred from 1980-1990, and a period low recruitments occurred from 2004-2010 (Figure 9.\@ref(fig:recdevs)). The age-0 recruitment was fixed to equal mean recruitment for the most recent four years because too few flathead sole are observed at ages 0-3 to estimate recruitment reliably for recent years.

Flathead sole do not seem to exhibit a stock-recruitment relationship because large recruitment has occurred during periods of high and low biomass (Figure 9.\@ref(fig:biofreccompare) and Table 9.\@ref(tab:timeseriest)).`r model_name` does not specify an explicit stock-recruitment relationship. The average annual recruitment (in numbers) spawned after 1976 is estimated to be `r prettyNum(round(1e-6*with(subset(mod18.2c_2024$timeseries, Yr %in% 1977:2024), mean(Recruit_0)),3), big.mark = ',')` million.

## Model Evaluation

### Comparison to Previous Model

A comparison of key derived quantities from the base model and the most recent full assessment is shown in Figure 9.\@ref(fig:biofreccompare). Parameter estimates, fits to the data and likelihood values have remained similar to `r old_model_name`. 

As has resulted in the BSAI FHS models since 2012 (@Monnahan2020, @McGilliard_2016, @McGilliard_2014, and @Stockhausen_2012), the estimated survey length composition often expects larger proportions of fish in the 20-30 cm range than has been observed. Several hypotheses have been explored through additional model runs about why this residual pattern occurred (@McGilliard_2016) by testing more flexible selectivity patterns, a four-parameter growth curve, more complexity in CV in length at age, alternative and data weighting schemes, yet none of these tests improved the residual pattern nor fit to the data. One last, untested hypothesis is that the data do not fully characterize the variability in length at age for this stock. In other words, the distribution of lengths for the fish with otoliths collected does not match the length distribution of all fish sampled. This hypothesis was not explored here but could be in future assessments.

Similarly, overall fits to fishery age and length composition data were reasonable, but not perfect Figures 9.\@ref(fig:fishagecomps) through 9.\@ref(fig:lengthcompsResidOSAFishMal)).
The yearly distributions of ages varied from year to year, suggesting that perhaps a larger sample of ages from the fishery each year would improve our knowledge of the distribution of ages caught by the fishery. One very large Pearson residual occurred in fits to male fishery length-composition data in 1983 (Figure 9.\@ref(fig:lengthcompsResidPearson)), which might be driven by a plus-group observation so large as to be a data entry error, and disappears upon calculation of one-step-ahead residuals (Figure 9.\@ref(fig:lengthcompsResidOSAFishMal)).  The aggregate fits to the fishery length composition data suggest that the fishery caught more 45-60cm males than were expected (Figure 9.\@ref(fig:fishagecomps)), but this is mostly driven by misfits before 1989; we would not expect the fits to this data source to be as good given the low Francis weight applied to these data in the joint likelihood.

### Residual Analysis and Convergence Criteria

The model achieved convergence as defined by an invertible Hessian matrix and a low maximum gradient component (less than `1e-4`) which was achieved using the `hess_step` function in ADMB. Time-series plots of observed and predicted values (e.g. Figure 9.\@ref(fig:survey)), and the time-series of recruitment deviations (Figure 9.\@ref(fig:recdevs)) did not suggest unusual residual patterns, or different behavior than in previous assessments. The uncertainty around parameter estimates and related derived quantities were in line with previous models (Tables 9.\@ref(tab:parposteriorst) and 9.\@ref(tab:timeseriest)).

### Parameter Estimates and Parameter Uncertainty

Table 9.\@ref(tab:parposteriorst) shows the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of key parameters in `r model_name` with corresponding 95% credible intervals given by the asymptotic uncertainty. Time series of deviation parameters (fishing mortality rates $F$ and recruitment deviations from `r paste0(mod18.2c_2024$startyr,'-',mod18.2c_2024$endyr)` are shown in Figures 9.\@ref(fig:biofreccompare) and 9.\@ref(fig:recdevs), respectively.
