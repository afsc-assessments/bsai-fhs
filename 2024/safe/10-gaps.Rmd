# Data Gaps and Research Priorities 
> Operational Update: The reader is referred to the last full stock assessment [@Monnahan2020] for the entirety of the BSAI FHS Data Gaps and Research Priorities section. The sole update to this section concerns the genetic distinction between Bering flounder and Flathead sole:

A collection of flathead sole from the Aleutian Islands (n=24) was analyzed using low coverage whole genome sequencing along with collections of yellowfin sole (*Limanda aspera*) and Bering flounder (*Hippoglossoides robustus*) (Figure 9.\@ref(fig:genetics1)). Results confirmed that flathead sole is genetically distinct from Bering flounder, which is significant given that they are identical at cytochrome b (@Kartavtsev2008). A principal components analysis (Figure 9.\@ref(fig:genetics2)) shows clear separation among flathead sole, Bering flounder, and yellowfin sole, and the differences are all relatively similar; no two species appear more similar than others. This is significant because previous analyses based on cytochrome b, morphometric, and protein data have suggested synonymization of Hippoglossoides robustus under H. elassodon. (@Hardy2011). Further analysis is needed to examine whether there is genetic diversity among flathead sole from the Aleutian Islands vs. eastern Bering Sea. We recommend that a collection of flathead sole (n=25) from the eastern Bering Sea survey be sequenced in 2025.
