# Ecosystem Considerations

> Operational Update: The Ecosystem Considerations for BSAI FHS are unchanged. The reader is referred to the last full assessment [@Monnahan2020] for the entirety of this section, which has been summarized below.  

In general, a determination of ecosystem considerations for BSAI FHS is hampered by the lack of biological and habitat information.

## Ecosystem Effects on the Stock

**Prey availability/abundance trends**: Similar to many other rockfish species, stock condition of POP appears to be influenced by periodic abundant year classes. Availability of suitable zooplankton prey items in sufficient quantity for larval or post-larval POP may be an important determining factor of year class strength.

**Predator population trends**:  POP are preyed upon by a variety of other fish at all life stages, and to some extent marine mammals during late juvenile and adult stages. Whether the impact of any particular predator is significant or dominant is unknown.

**Changes in physical environment**: Stronger year classes corresponding to the period around 1977 have been reported for many species of groundfish in the GOA, including POP, northern rockfish, sablefish, and Pacific cod. Therefore, it appears that environmental conditions may have changed during this period in such a way that survival of young-of-the-year fish increased for many groundfish species, including slope rockfish. POP appeared to have strong 1986-88 year classes, and there may be other years when environmental conditions were especially favorable for rockfish species. The environmental mechanism for this increased survival remains unknown.
